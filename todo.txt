EVENTUALLY
- use different gold icons to show general amount
- let player see attack history at a frontier
- use penant image when monarch is traveling
- show benefits of next upgrade somewhere
- combat bonus from monarch being present
- should wall levels be tied to capital upgrades?
- (maybe) cities shouldn't produce new idle citizens when there are too there already
- penalties for monarch moving around outside walls at night
- clean up image icon fields in node control panel (maybe a dictionary?)
  - or separate object for each menu
- lull in attacks after losing a node
- would be nice to have a way to train & recruit to ret in one step
- (maybe) show how much defense comes from soldiers vs walls
- losing a frontier when you move off with ret is too fragile
- when placing a farm b/c there weren't any close enough, don't put it adjacenr to a farm which is just out of range
- make construction progress wheel match color of workers
- handle victorious armies when monarch is not there when sortie finishes
- three digit subject counts in node detail panel are obscured
- acheivements that are tracked over time
