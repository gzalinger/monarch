- REPRODUCE: lost soldier when node was destroyed from walking off it
- put all code on github
- reduce nightly variance in attacks at each frontier
- more farms



EVENTUALLY
- player should be able to pick from maps and difficulty settings in main menu
- use different gold icons to show general amount
- center text label under node control buttons
- let player see attack history at a frontier
- use penant image when monarch is traveling
- show benefits of next upgrade somewhere
- combat bonus from monarch being present
- should wall levels be tied to capital upgrades?
- (maybe) cities shouldn't produce new idle citizens when there are too there already
- penalties for monarch moving around outside walls at night
- clean up image icon fields in node control panel (maybe a dictionary?)
- lull in attacks after losing a node
- would be nice to have a way to train & recruit to ret in one step
- text for building farm, city, etc with costs overlaps in control panel
- (maybe) show how much defense comes from soldiers vs walls
- losing a frontier when you move off with ret is too fragile
- don't have farms adjacent to other farms
- total housing cap should be tracked, not constantly recalculated
- when placing a farm b/c there weren't any close enough, don't put it adjacenr to a farm which is just out of range
- show breakdown of housing sources in kindgom overview
- make construction progress wheel match color of workers
- add walls beyond level 5
- consider setting a max price for soldiers
